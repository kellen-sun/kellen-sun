## Hello There, I'm Kellen! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first-year computer science (BCs co-op, class of 2028) student at the University of Waterloo. I graduated from Earl of March S.S. in 2023.

I enjoy working on challenging and meaningful projects by tackling issues in real life. I have software development experience in Python, JS and C++. I also enjoy participating in math and computing contests (COMC, CCC, ICPC, Putnam, etc).

I like to read books, draw and work out in my free time. 

I'm currently learning more about Javascript for web development and algorithms for LeetCode.

I'm currently working on building a portfolio website.
