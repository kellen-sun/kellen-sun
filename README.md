## Hello There, I'm Kellen! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year computer science (BCs co-op, class of 2028) student at the University of Waterloo. I graduated from Earl of March S.S. in 2023.

I enjoy working on challenging and meaningful projects by tackling issues in real life. I have software development experience in Python, C++ and JS. 

I like to read books, draw and work out in my free time. 

## I'm currently working on:

I'm learning about machine learning with a hands-on approach through the projects I'm building in my "Exploring_AI" repository. I like to reason and gain an intuitive understanding of how models work as mathematical objects and how they perceive the world.

I'm also working on creating a poker engine which can host competitions between poker bots. 

Finally, I want to spend more time learning more math especially in real analysis and linear algebra while exploring interesting problems that may arise from these subjects. I'm also planning on going through a more in-depth on modern web development stacks.
